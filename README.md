# Penny
Penny is an L2 penny auction dapp for NFTs deployed on the Metis Stardust testnet.
It allows users to mint test NFTs, list them for auction and place bids on the NFTs. 

# How to use
Make sure you are connected to the Stardust testnet and have a web3 compatible extension.
If there aren't any auctions running, mint a test token in the dashboard and list your own!
